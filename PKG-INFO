Description: INSTALL
        =======
        
        put easy_thumbnails_watermark in INSTALLED_APPS
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'easy_thumbnails_watermark',
            )
        
        add the watermark preprocesor in your settings
        
        ::
        
            from easy_thumbnails.conf import Settings as easy_thumbnails_defaults
        
            THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS = easy_thumbnails_defaults.THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS + (
                'easy_thumbnails_watermark.thumbnail_processors.watermark_processor',
            )
        
        and add 'WATERMARK': , to your thumbnail definition for easy_thumbnails.
        
        ::
        
                'thumb': {
                    ...
                    'WATERMARK': { 
                        'image': 'main/img/logo.png',
                        'opacity': 0.2,
                        'scale': '40%',
                    },
                    ...
                },
        
        And one of the following settings:
        
        * ``image`` - A path to an image in your static files folder
        * ``position`` - Specify the relative position in one of four image corners ``BR``, ``BL``,
            ``TR``, and ``TL``.  These represent 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', 'top-right', and 'top-left' respectively.
            
          Alternatively, you can use relative or absolute positioning for the
          watermark.  Relative positioning uses percentages; absolute positioning uses
          exact pixels.  You can mix and match these two modes of positioning, but you
          cannot mix and match relative/absolute with the corner positioning.  When
          using relative/absolute positioning, the value for the ``position`` parameter
          is ``XxY``, where ``X`` is the left value and ``Y`` is the top value.  The
          left and top values must be separated with a lowercase ``x``.
        
          If you wanted your watermark image to show up in the center of any image you
          want to watermark, you would use a position parameter such as
          ``position=50%x50%`` or even ``position=C``.  If you wanted the watermark to
          show up half-way between the left and right edges of the image and 100 pixels
          from the top, you would use a position parameter such as
          ``position=50%x100``. 
        
          Finally, you may tell the filter to generate a position for your watermark
          dynamically.  To do this, use ``position=R``.
        * ``opacity`` - This parameter allows you to specify the transparency of the
          applied watermark.  The value must be an integer between 0 and 1, where 0
          is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.  By default, the opacity is set
          at 0.5.
        * ``tile`` - If you want your watermark to tile across the entire image, you
          simply specify a parameter such as ``tile=1``.
        * ``scale`` - If you'd like to have the watermark as big as possible on the
          target image and fully visible, you might want to use ``scale=F``.  If you
          want to specify a particular scaling factor, just use something like
          ``scale=1.43``.
          Scale could also be a percentage of the smallest image, the one to be watermarked,
          dimension, for example '20%' would scale the watermark to be 20% of the smallest
          between width and height of the target image.
        * ``greyscale`` - If you want your watermark to be greyscale, you can specify
          the parameter ``greyscale=1`` and all color saturation will go away.
        * ``rotation`` - Set this parameter to any integer between 0 and 359 (really
          any integer should work, but for your own sanity I recommend keeping the
          value between 0 and 359).  If you want the rotation to be random, use
          ``rotation=R`` instead of an integer.
        
        
        They defaults to  watermark=False, position='C', opacity=100, scale=1, tile=False, greyscale=False, rotation=0
